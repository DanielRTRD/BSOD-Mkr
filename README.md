# BSOD Mkr 1.0
BSOD Mkr is an easy to use software that displays a fake BSoD (Blue Screen of Death) Windows error on your screen. 

This is the first and oldes version, check out v2 for more up-to-date code. This repo is currently a work in progress, I need to find my files on old harddrives.

## History
BSOD Mkr was started back in autumn of 2009 when Daniel and his friend, Andreas, was talking about how fun it would be to see our brothers faces when their computer got a BSOD. The development was great in the beginning but after a short while it wasn't updated for a year. So in November of 2010 it was updated to 1.0. A year later, in September of 2011, then it was updated again and it was held updated thru 2012. Then in 2014 Daniel started development of v2.0, this application, and the development stopped in April of 2015. Now over five years later Daniel decided to publish this for the world to see.
